				<h1>Andrew McBride</h1>
				<img src="Me.jpg" />
				<p>My name is Andrew McBride. I was born on the 15th of July 1996, in Dublin, Ireland.
				I've been living in Dublin all my life. I am currently enrolled in the computing 
				course at the National College of Ireland. I completed my Leaving Certificate in 2015
				and since then, I have worked part-time in Dunnes Stores and have travelled a little bit 
				with my friends.
				</p>
				<p>Some of my hobbies include, football, fitness, gaming and socialising with friends.
				I am a member of O'Toole's GAA club and currently on the football senior development squad. 
				I like to travel, when I can, with my friends to watch football matches. I have seen many 
				Champions League matches in some big European stadiums, such as, Old Trafford, the Nou Camp and the Amsterdam Arena.
